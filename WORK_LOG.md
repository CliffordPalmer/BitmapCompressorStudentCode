| April 5     |     9-10pm      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| November 15 |   2:30-3:00pm   |                                                   Problemset was announced. It seems decently straight forward. We know it likely will involve compressing by storying the amount of 1s or 0s in a row, but there might be a clever way to save as much space as possible. Talked through a lot of options, settled on searching the bitmap for the longest string of 1s or 0s, and making the max length of a repetition this max length. |
| November 20 | 9:30pm-10:00pm  |                                                                                     Unfortunately was sick over the weekend. Began implementing the proposed solution. I struggled for a while to figure out a clever way to store the bitmap to parse for the longest repeated sequence. Finally settled on recording the length of repeats in an arraylist. This works well, and will be useful later when I actually start compressing. |
| November 20 |  10:00-10:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Started parsing for the longest repeat. It's difficult without a debugger, but I think it should be working. I'll only be able to tell once I finish the expander though. |
| November 20 |  10:30-11:00pm  |                                  The actual compression wasn't too difficult. I just go through my arraylist and write the int stored in the appropriate amount of bits. Also realized that allocating bits based on the max length of repetition isn't a great solution. Definitely will waste space on all the shorter repeats. Will need to rethink, but for now it would be great to just get it compressing and expanding losslessly. |
| November 20 | 11:00pm-11:30pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                             Hmmmm. The tricky thing with no debugger is that it's hard to know if you made a mistake before completing the whole solution. Wrote an expander, but the whole thing doesn't work. Probably something wrong in my compressor. |
| November 21 |  11:25-11:55pm  | We got the big reveal today. Turns out that allocating 8 bits, so a maximum repetition length of 255, is convenient and works pretty well compression wise. Depending on the bitmap, there may be better options, but that would require some sort of gradient ascent to narrow in on the right amount of bits. Right now, I'm just try to implement it with 8 bit chunks. Got pretty far during class, just didn't quite finish expander. |

Had an extra zero at the start of each expansion, so fixed that and now it works on all cases. Yay! Finished up comments. |
